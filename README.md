## Project Deliverables

This project provides an interactive map of earthquake data, including:

- A map with markers representing earthquake events.
- Markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude.
- Markers with colors based on the earthquake depth.
- Popups with information about the earthquake, including magnitude, location, and depth.
- A legend that displays the depth intervals and their corresponding colors.
